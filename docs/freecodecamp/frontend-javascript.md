# Basic Javascript

## Comment your JavaScript Code

Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using `//` will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

`// This is an in-line comment.`

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with `/* and ending with */`:

> Practice

```js
/* This is a 
   multi-line comment */
```

**Best Practice**

As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

> Practice

```js
// comment

/*
This is Comment
*/
```

## Declare JavaScript Variables

In computer science, `data` is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different `data types` which are `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `string`, `symbol`, `number`, and `object`.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number `12`, and `strings`, such as `"12"`, `"dog"`, or `"123 cats"`, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

`Variables` allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

`Variables` are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer `variables` differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or `declare` a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

`var ourName;`

creates a `variable` called `ourName`. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.

`Variable` names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or \_, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

> Practice

```js
// Example
var ourName;

// Define myName below this line
var myName;
```

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the `assignment` operator.

`myVariable = 5;`

Assigns the `Number` value `5` to `myVariable`.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the `=` operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

```js
myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
```

Assigns `5` to `myVar` and then resolves `myVar` to `5` again and assigns it to `myNum`.

> Practice

```js
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
```

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

It is common to `initialize` a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

`var myVar = 0;`

Creates a new variable called `myVar` and assigns it an initial value of `0`.

> Practice

```js
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 9;
```

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of `undefined`. If you do a mathematical operation on an `undefined` variable your result will be NaN which means `"Not a Number"`. If you concatenate a string with an `undefined` variable, you will get a literal `string` of `"undefined"`.

> Practice

```js
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

## Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

Write variable names in Javascript in `camelCase`. In `camelCase`, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples:**

```js
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;
```

> Practice

```js
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```

## Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
```

> Practice

```js
var sum = 10 + 10;
```

## Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
```

> Practice

```js
var difference = 45 - 33;
```

## Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169
```

> Practice

```js
var product = 8 * 10;
```

## Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8
```

> Practice

```js
var quotient = 66 / 33;
```

## Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily `increment` or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

**Note**
The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

> Practice

```js
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
```

## Decrement a Number with JavaScript

You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i - 1;`

Note
The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

> Practice

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
```

## Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as `floating point` numbers or `floats`.

Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in `floating point`. This can lead to rounding errors.

> Practice

```js
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = ourDecimal;
```

## Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

> Practice

```js
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;
```

## Divide one Decimal by Another with JavaScript

Now let's divide one decimal by another.

> Practice

```js
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;
```
