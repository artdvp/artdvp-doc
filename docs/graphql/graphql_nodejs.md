## Tutorial - Introduction

> Note: The final project for this tutorial can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-js). You can always use it as a reference whenever you get lost throughout the course of the following chapters. Also note that each code block is annotated with a filename. These annotations directly link to the corresponding file on GitHub so you can clearly see where to put the code and what the end result will look like.
